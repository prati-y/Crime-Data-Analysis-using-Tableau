# Crime-Data-Analysis-using-Tableau

The LAPD publicly provides a dataset covering crime incidents in the City of Los Angeles from 2020 to Feb 2023.

The goal of the crime data analysis using Tableau is to explore the dataset and gain insights into crime patterns in Los Angeles, specifically to identify which type of crime results in the highest victimization rate and how this relates to ethnicity, age, and gender.

The analysis provides valuable information for citizens to better understand what is happening in their city, identify hot spots of crime and safety issues, and make informed decisions about where to live, travel, and socialize.

We have used Excel for data cleaning and the pdf document covers the Data Cleaning Steps, Data Visualization, Dashboard and Storytelling.
